This folder contains all the scripts used to generate all the figures in the paper (except for Figure 1, which shows the study area map and is generated by ArcGIS Pro). Heat wave and cold snap library datasets are required to generate these figures, and then can be downloaded from Zeneodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15306963). 

1. "Average_by_NERC.ipynb" is to plot extreme event intensity (Figure 2), event frequency (Figure 3), event duration (Figure 4), and event spatial coverage (Figure 5).
2. "Average_by_NERC_supplementary_document.ipynb" is  to generate Figure S1 - S4. 
3. "Visualizations_of_events.ipynb" is to visualize extreme thermal events in 1980 under definition 4 (Figure 6).
